        I have no idea how to start solving this mission

    <div class="answer">
        Don't try to use recursion from the top down. Take a look at the pyramid from bottom to up. For each row you can choose the previous best step.

        First you will need to create a work copy list (you'll need mutable data type).

<pre class="brush: python">
work = list(list(row) for row in pyramid)
</pre>

    <div class="answer">
        Now iterate all of the rows going from bottom to top.

<pre class="brush: python">
for i in range(len(work) - 1, 0 , -1):
    row = work[i] # we can make this with enumerate also
    for j in range(len(work[i])):
        ...

    <div class="answer">
        For each step you need to choose the best variant from the lower level and accumulate this.

<pre class="brush: python">
...
    ...
        work[i][j] += max(work[i+1][j], work[i+1][j+1])
</pre>

        I tried all I could. Nothing works. SOS

    <div class="answer">
        As a result of all this, you will get the best total in the top of the work pyramid.
